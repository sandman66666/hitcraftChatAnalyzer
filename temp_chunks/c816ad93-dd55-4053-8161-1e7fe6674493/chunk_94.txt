  "About this song: 20 years ago I use in sing for rock bands and had the time of my life both on and off the stage. It was a lifestyle that I loved, but it was also destructive and came with many impaired judgments. When I started my family 15 years ago, I made the decision to stop playing music and focus on being present with my children. 20 Years later, I am beginning to feel called back to the stage and to try it all again, but I am torn because that lifestyle is not going to be productive to supporting what I have built at home which I love so much. But that dark side of me wants out, it wants to devour all of the â€œwhat ifâ€™sâ€ that highnsite has tortured me with for the past two decades. It makes me feel alive, and at 40 years old I donâ€™t a times anymore. If I let it out, no telling what will happen. If I donâ€™t, it might eat me alive. The dark in me is like a shadow, following me every steps with constant reminders that it wants out. No longer buried deep, its pepared to go to war with me for its freedom to express, create, and indulge in all of its desires. The chorus of this song is from the perspective of the dark shadow side within me, the verses are from my perspective. The bridge is the shadow winning the war and coming back to life."

  ""Shadow Side" by Ready Set Fire is a gripping exploration of the internal conflict between suppressed desires and the need for self-expression. The track delves into the psychological battle of confronting oneâ€™s darker instinctsâ€”the 'shadow'â€”that lurks beneath the surface, demanding release. With its haunting vocals and searing instrumentals, the song evokes the tension of breaking free from internal restraints, while acknowledging the destructive potential of untamed impulses. The relentless drive of the chorus captures the urgent push for freedom, while the bridge symbolizes the overpowering force of the shadow finally taking control. Itâ€™s a powerful narrative of personal reckoning, resonating with anyone who has faced the struggle of reconciling their complex, multifaceted self."

  "Song Title: Shadow Side
Lyrics Written By: Drew Petrone

Chorus:
Iâ€™m breaking through the other sideTo get back here to settle the scoreIâ€™ve never felt more aliveSo prepare this is war

Verse 1:
Locked away inside, inside of meIs my shadow side, and it's chasing meI thought that I could hideBut it followed meThe monster lives insideAnd it wants freeBut Iâ€™m left screaming

Chorus:
Iâ€™m breaking through the other sideTo get back here to settle the scoreIâ€™ve never felt more aliveSo prepare this is warSound the alarm

Verse 2:
In your shadow sideYou call to meCuz in the darkness lies a realityFar beyond your mindA ProphecyLocked away to hideBut it wants freeBut Iâ€™m left screaming

Chorus:
Iâ€™m breaking through the other sideTo get back here to settle the scoreIâ€™ve never felt more aliveSo prepare this is war

Bridge:
Now it's time to run for coverShadow side is taking overFrom inside the dark gets closerSurrounding me

Chorus:
Iâ€™m breaking through the other sideTo get back here to settle the scoreIâ€™ve never felt more aliveSo prepare this is warSound the alarm

So prepare this is war"

  "Creating a music video for "Shadow Side" is an exciting way to visually represent your song and connect with your audience! While I can't produce the video directly, I can guide you through the process of planning and creating an engaging music video. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to get you started:

### ğŸ¥ Music Video Creation Plan for "Shadow Side"

**1. Define Your Concept**
   - **Theme:** What message or story do you want to convey? Since "Shadow Side" explores internal conflict and self-expression, consider visuals that reflect these themes.
   - **Visual Style:** Decide on the overall aesthetic. Do you want it to be dark and moody, or more colorful and vibrant? Think about how this aligns with the song's mood.

**2. Storyboarding**
   - Create a storyboard to outline each scene. Sketch or write down what happens in each part of the song. Consider the following:
     - **Opening Scene:** Introduce the artist or band in a relevant setting (e.g., a dimly lit room, a forest, or an urban landscape).
     - **Key Moments:** Highlight specific lyrics with impactful visuals (e.g., showing a characterâ€™s struggle).
     - **Finale:** Conclude with a strong visual that encapsulates the songâ€™s message.

**3. Location Scouting**
   - Choose locations that fit your theme. Consider:
     - **Local Spots:** Look for unique places in Citrus County that could enhance the visuals (e.g., parks, abandoned buildings, or scenic views).
     - **Indoor Settings:** If you prefer a more controlled environment, consider renting a space or using a home studio.

**4. Casting**
   - Decide if you want to include actors or dancers. If so, reach out to friends or local performers who can embody the emotions of the song. 

**5. Filming**
   - **Equipment:** Use a good camera (even a smartphone can work with the right lighting) and consider using tripods or stabilizers for steady shots.
   - **Lighting:** Pay attention to lighting to create the desired atmosphere. Natural light can be great, but donâ€™t hesitate to use artificial lights or reflectors.

**6. Editing**
   - Use editing software (like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or even free options like DaVinci Resolve) to piece together your footage.
   - Incorporate effects, transitions, and color grading to enhance the visuals. Sync the footage with the audio of "Shadow Side" for a polished final result.

**7. Release and Promotion**
   - Once your video is complete, plan a release strategy. Consider premiering it on platforms like YouTube or social media.
   - Promote the video through your social media channels, local influencers, and music blogs.

### ğŸ¬ Next Steps
- **Concept Development:** Spend some time brainstorming specific ideas for your music video.
- **Storyboarding:** Create a storyboard to visualize your scenes.
- **Location and Casting:** Start scouting locations and reaching out to potential cast members.

By following these steps, you can create a compelling music video that brings "Shadow Side" to life visually. If you have any specific ideas or need help with certain aspects of the process, feel free to share, and we can brainstorm together!"

  "Awesome! Having three verses and a chorus is a solid foundation. Let's work on structuring your song. Hereâ€™s a typical structure for a Country Gospel song that you might consider:

### Suggested Structure:
1. **Intro**: A short musical intro to set the mood.
2. **Verse 1**: Introduces the theme or story.
3. **Chorus**: The main message or hook of the song.
4. **Verse 2**: Builds on the story or theme presented in Verse 1.
5. **Chorus**: Repeats the main message, reinforcing it.
6. **Verse 3**: Provides a resolution or deeper insight into the story.
7. **Chorus**: Often repeated, sometimes with slight variations.
8. **Outro**: A closing section that wraps up the song.

### Next Steps:
- **Share Your Lyrics**: If youâ€™re comfortable, could you share your lyrics for the verses and chorus? I can help refine them and suggest ways to enhance the flow.
- **Consider a Bridge**: Sometimes, adding a bridge can provide a nice contrast and elevate the emotional impact. We can brainstorm ideas for that if you're interested!

Letâ€™s get your song structured beautifully!"

Let him lay his hands upon you         Let his love shine down on you
Donâ€™t be afraid to kneel

Verse 2
I remember a revival,  My grandma right beside me singing the hymns of praise
She said baby youâ€™re a wild one just like my son and the man who married me
But when your troubles are many and your heart is to heavy
just reach out and call his name, 
Heâ€™ll always be there for you and heâ€™ll send his love down on you, 
â€œJust Donâ€™t Be Afraid To Kneelâ€ 

Chorus:
Donâ€™t be afraid to kneel  Donâ€™t be afraid to kneel
Let him lay his hands upon you        Let him put a healing on you
Donâ€™t to afraid to kneel

Verse 3  
I staggered to the kitchen, My mind in opposition to the pain that was filling me
I was looking for salvation from the poison that wasting and slowly killing me
As I fumbled through mess I saw a Gideon Bible that beckoned out to me
I saw it was open to words of salvation Good old, â€œJohn 3:16â€

Chorus:
 Bridge-Prechorus 
It was then I was humbled   As I fell down to my kneeâ€™s 
Asking Jesus to Please Save Me 
I felt His Love surround me as his healing came down on me 
 and the demon fled from me

Chorus:
Donâ€™t be afraid to kneel, Donâ€™t be afraid to kneel
Let Jesus fill your heart And his Spirit         
And Jesus Let him put a healing on you
Donâ€™t to afraid to kneel"

  "Got it! Click and cue tracks are a great way to prepare for live performances or recordings. To help you set this up, I'll need a bit more information:

1. **What DAW or software are you using for your tracks?**
2. **Do you have a specific BPM (beats per minute) you want to maintain across your tracks?**
3. **Are there any specific cues or markers you want to set in your tracks?**

Once I have more context, I can provide you with detailed steps to create your click and cue tracks!"

  "No worries at all! Everyone starts somewhere, and it's perfectly okay to feel that way. Letâ€™s break it down into even simpler steps to help you get comfortable with setting up your click and cue tracks. 

### Simplified Steps for Click and Cue Tracks in Suno

1. **Create a Click Track:**
   - Open your project in Suno.
   - Look for an option to add a new audio track (usually found in the menu).
   - Label this track â€œClick Track.â€

2. **Set the Metronome:**
   - Find the metronome or tempo settings in Suno.
   - Set it to the BPM you want for your song. If you're unsure, a common starting point is around 120 BPM.

3. **Mark Your Sections:**
   - Play your track and listen for the different parts (Intro, Verse 1, etc.).
   - You can write down the time markers where each section starts. For example, if Verse 1 starts at 0:30, note that down!

4. **Add Cues:**
   - If you're comfortable, try recording a simple voice cue for each section. Just say â€œIntro,â€ â€œChorus,â€ etc.
   - Alternatively, you can just make a note of where each section starts and follow that during practice.

5. **Play and Adjust:**
   - Hit play and listen to your track with the metronome.
   - If it feels off, you can adjust the volume of the click track until it feels right.

### Encouragement
Take it one step at a time, and donâ€™t hesitate to ask for help if you get stuck! Youâ€™re doing great by taking the initiative to get your music out there. If youâ€™d like, I can guide you through any specific step in more detail, just let me know!"

  "Great! Since you're using Suno for your track, let's outline how you can set up your click and cue tracks to match your song structure. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Setting Up Click and Cue Tracks in Suno

1. **Create a Click Track:**
   - In your project, add a new audio track and label it â€œClick Track.â€
   - Set the metronome to your desired BPM. This will provide a consistent tempo for your performance.

2. **Add Cue Markers:**
   - Identify the sections of your song: Intro, Verse 1, Chorus, Verse 2, Bridge, Chorus, Verse 3 (x2).
   - You can use markers or regions in Suno to label these sections. This will help you keep track of where each part starts.

3. **Recording Cues:**
   - For each section, you could either record a spoken cue (e.g., â€œIntro,â€ â€œChorusâ€) or use simple sound effects that indicate the transition.
   - Place these cues at the beginning of each section in the timeline.

4. **Adjusting Levels:**
   - Make sure the click track is at a comfortable level so itâ€™s audible but not overpowering.
   - Adjust the volume of your cues accordingly.

5. **Testing:**
   - Play through the track to ensure that the click and cues align properly with your music. Make any necessary adjustments.

### Next Steps
- **Practice with the Click Track:** Spend some time getting used to playing along with the click and cues.
- **Refine Your Performance:** If you find any sections challenging, consider looping those parts to practice.

If you have any specific questions or need help with a particular part of this process, feel free to ask!"

  "Absolutely! I can help you outline a concise plan so you can tackle it when you have some time. Hereâ€™s a quick step-by-step guide that you can follow at your own pace:

### Quick Plan for Setting Up Click and Cue Tracks in Suno

1. **Create a Click Track:**
   - Open Suno and add a new audio track.
   - Label it â€œClick Track.â€

2. **Set the Metronome:**
   - Find the metronome in the app and set it to your desired BPM (start with 120 BPM if unsure).

3. **Identify Sections:**

4. **Add Simple Cues:**
   - If you can, record a quick voice cue for each section (like saying â€œChorusâ€).
   - If recording is too much for now, just keep your written notes handy.

5. **Play and Adjust:**
   - Hit play to listen and see how the click track feels. Adjust the volume if needed.

### Final Thoughts
When you have a moment, just take it one step at a time. Thereâ€™s no rush, and practicing at your own pace will help you feel more comfortable with the app. 

If you need help or have questions once you start working on it, feel free to reach out again. Youâ€™ve got this! Enjoy your music journey, and Iâ€™m here whenever you need support."

  "Got it! If someone was already working on a click and cue track for you, it sounds like you're on the right path. Since I can't directly access your files, I can offer guidance on how to finish that process or help you with any specific questions you have about the setup.

### Hereâ€™s What You Can Do:
1. **Check with That Person:** Reach out to the person who was putting together the click and cue track for any updates or to see if they need anything from you.
  
2. **Follow Up on Progress:** If you have any specific instructions or sections you'd like to ensure are included, communicate those to them.

3. **Ask Questions:** If you have any uncertainties about what theyâ€™ve done so far or how to use the track, donâ€™t hesitate to ask them for clarification.

  "Thatâ€™s completely understandable! Starting with a new app can feel overwhelming, but youâ€™re already making progress by reaching out for help. Letâ€™s simplify things further and focus on how to get comfortable using the app. Here are some easy steps to help you get started:

### Getting Comfortable with the Suno App

1. **Explore the Interface:**
   - Spend a few minutes just clicking around the app. Familiarize yourself with where things areâ€”like the play button, tracks, and settings. 

2. **Watch Tutorials:**
   - If Suno offers any tutorials or help sections, check them out! They can provide visual guidance thatâ€™s often easier to follow than written instructions.

3. **Start with One Track:**
   - Instead of trying to set up everything at once, focus on one track at a time. Pick your favorite song you've written and work on that one first.
  
4. **Practice Basic Functions:**
   - Try simple tasks like playing your track, pausing it, and adjusting the volume. Getting used to these basics will build your confidence.

5. **Use Your Phone or Tablet:**
   - If youâ€™re using the app on your mobile device, hold it in a comfortable position and just play around with it casually, like you would with any app.

### Next Steps
- **Set Small Goals:** Aim to accomplish one small task each time you open the app. For example, today you could just play a track, and tomorrow you might try adding a cue.
- **Ask Questions:** If you get stuck at any point, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out! I'm here to help guide you through it.

Remember, itâ€™s perfectly okay to take your time learning the app. Youâ€™re investing in your music journey, and thatâ€™s a fantastic step forward! Let me know how youâ€™d like to proceed or if there's a specific feature you want to tackle next."

  "What brings you to HitCraft today? Are you working on a new project, or do you have a specific challenge or question you'd like to address? If you need help with creating a click and cue track in Soundtrap, I can guide you through the process!

### Hereâ€™s how to create a Click and Cue Track in Soundtrap:

1. **Open Your Project:**
   - Go to your Soundtrap account and open the project you want to work on.

2. **Add a New Track:**
   - Click on the "+" icon to add a new audio track. You can label this track â€œClick Track.â€

3. **Set Up the Metronome:**
   - Soundtrap has a built-in metronome. Click on the metronome icon in the toolbar and set it to your desired BPM.

4. **Record the Click:**
   - Hit the record button to capture the metronome in your new track. You can record for the length of your song or just the sections you need.

5. **Add Cue Points:**
   - You can either record your voice giving cues at the start of each section or add text annotations in the track to remind you where each section starts.

6. **Adjust Levels:**
   - Make sure the click track is at a comfortable volume compared to your main track.

7. **Save Your Changes:**
   - Once you're happy with it, save your project.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with any of these steps, just let me know!"

  "Great! Now that I have your demo, we can explore several options to polish it into a hit. Here are a few areas we could focus on:

1. **Mixing**: We can enhance the balance of your instruments, adjust levels, and add effects to create a fuller sound.

2. **Production Elements**: We can add layers, harmonies, or instrumentation to bring more depth and interest to your track.

3. **Arrangement**: We can refine the structure of your song, making sure it flows well and maintains the listener's attention.

4. **Vocal Processing**: If you have vocals, we can work on tuning, effects, and placement in the mix to make them shine.

5. **Mastering**: Once everything is mixed, we can prepare your track for distribution with mastering to ensure it sounds great across all platforms.

Which of these options are you most interested in pursuing? Or do you have something specific in mind? Letâ€™s make your demo shine!"

  "It looks like the analysis of your demo is still in progress, so I can't play it back just yet. Once the analysis is complete, I'll be able to provide feedback and suggestions for polishing it up!

In the meantime, do you have any specific areas youâ€™d like me to focus on when we get to the mixing or production stage? For example, are there particular sounds or vibes you're aiming for? Let me know, and we can prepare for the next steps!"

If you're looking for an immediate way to hear your demo, you might want to play it in your DAW. Meanwhile, let me know if there are specific elements or aspects of the track you're particularly excited about or want to improve. That way, we can hit the ground running once I have the analysis results!"

  "It looks like we encountered an issue with your upload. The system couldn't detect the BPM (beats per minute) of your sketch, which often happens when the recording doesn't have a steady tempo or wasn't made with a metronome.

To create a more polished instrumental background, it's best to record with a metronome to keep a consistent rhythm. If you'd like to try again, consider using a metronome for your next recording. 

If you have any other ideas or sketches, feel free to share, and we can continue working together!"

  "While I can't provide a metronome directly here, I recommend using a metronome app on your phone or computer. There are many free options available that can help you set a specific BPM and keep time while you record.

Just search for "metronome" in your app store or use an online metronome website. Once you have it set up, you can start recording your voice with a steady beat, and then we can work on your instrumental background! If you have any questions about how to use it, feel free to ask!"

  "You can download a metronome app from your device's app store. Here are a few popular options:

1. **For iOS (iPhone/iPad)**:
   - Search for "Metronome" in the App Store. Some popular apps include **Pro Metronome** and **Metronome Beats**.

2. **For Android**:
   - Go to the Google Play Store and search for "Metronome". Apps like **Soundbrenner Metronome** and **Metronome Beats** are well-rated.

   - If you prefer a web-based solution, you can use websites like [metronomeonline.com](https://www.metronomeonline.com) or [onlinemetronome.com](https://www.onlinemetronome.com). These allow you to adjust the BPM and use the metronome directly in your browser.

  "Absolutely, I'd love to help you master plugin usage! Plugins can significantly enhance your sound and workflow in the studio. 

To get started, could you tell me more about the types of plugins you're working with (like effects, synths, or mixing tools), and what specific goals you have in mind? Are you looking to improve your mixing, sound design, or something else?

### Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what we can cover:

**1. Understanding Types of Plugins:**
   - **Effects Plugins**: Such as reverb, delay, EQ, and compression. We can discuss how to use them effectively in your mix.
   - **Virtual Instruments**: Synths and samplers. I can guide you through sound design techniques and layering.
   - **Utility Plugins**: Tools for metering, gain staging, and other essential tasks.

**2. Workflow Optimization:**
   - Tips for organizing your plugin library.
   - Strategies for using plugins in a way that enhances your creativity without slowing you down.

**3. Practical Techniques:**
   - How to apply EQ to carve out space in your mix.
   - Compression techniques to add punch and glue to your tracks.
   - Creative effects to enhance your sound (like modulation or distortion).

### Next Steps:
- Share more about your current setup, any specific plugins you want to work with, and what you're looking to achieve. We can dive deeper into specific techniques or concepts based on your input!"

  "Absolutely! Learning DAW shortcuts can significantly speed up your workflow and enhance your productivity. Which DAW are you using? Knowing that will help me provide you with the most relevant shortcuts.

In the meantime, here are some common shortcuts that are widely applicable across many DAWs:

**Basic Navigation:**
- **Zoom In/Out:** Use `Ctrl +` (or `Cmd +` on Mac) to zoom in, and `Ctrl -` (or `Cmd -`) to zoom out.
- **Play/Pause:** Spacebar is usually the go-to for starting and stopping playback.
- **Stop:** `Spacebar` again or `Shift + Spacebar` in some DAWs.

**Editing:**
- **Cut:** `Ctrl + X` (or `Cmd + X`).
- **Copy:** `Ctrl + C` (or `Cmd + C`).
- **Paste:** `Ctrl + V` (or `Cmd + V`).
- **Undo:** `Ctrl + Z` (or `Cmd + Z`).

**Track Management:**
- **New Track:** `Ctrl + T` (or `Cmd + T`).
- **Mute Track:** `M` key on the selected track.
- **Solo Track:** `S` key on the selected track.

These shortcuts may vary slightly depending on your specific DAW, so let me know which one you're using, and I can tailor the list even further!

### Next Steps:
1. **Practice:** Try using these shortcuts in your current project to reinforce your memory.
2. **Customization:** Check if your DAW allows you to customize shortcuts for specific actions.
3. **Explore:** Look for any additional shortcuts unique to your DAW for advanced functions.

Feel free to share more about your DAW, and I can provide specific shortcuts that are most useful for you!"
