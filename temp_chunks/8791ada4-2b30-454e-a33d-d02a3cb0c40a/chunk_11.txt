  "Absolutely! For a smoother rock sound reminiscent of the late 1960s, think along the lines of bands like The Eagles or The Byrds. These groups incorporated harmonies and melodic structure that you might find inspiring. 

Once I have your sketch ready, I can help you refine the sound by focusing on smooth vocal harmonies and blending instruments thoughtfully. 

Would you like to proceed with those influences in mind? If you can tell me more about the specific elements you want to keep or change from your demo, I can tailor the production to fit that vibe even better!"

  "Got it! To achieve a deeper and more reflective tone for your vocals, here are some strategies we can consider:

### Vocal Production Tips:
1. **EQ Adjustments**: 
   - **Low-End Boost**: Gently boost the lower frequencies (around 80-200Hz) to add depth to the vocal. Be careful not to overdo it, as it can muddy the mix.
   - **High-End Roll-Off**: Consider cutting some of the higher frequencies (above 10kHz) to reduce brightness and create a warmer, more reflective sound.

2. **Compression**:
   - Use a compressor to even out the vocal dynamics. Aim for a moderate ratio (around 3:1) and set the attack and release to let some of the natural tone shine through while keeping it smooth.

3. **Reverb and Delay**:
   - Adding a subtle reverb can create a sense of space and depth. A longer decay time might enhance the reflective quality.
   - A slight delay can also add fullness to the vocals. Experiment with short delay times to see what complements the vibe.

4. **Vocal Recording Techniques**:
   - If possible, re-record the vocals with a slightly lower pitch or use pitch-shifting tools to achieve a deeper tone.
   - Encourage the vocalist to sing with a more resonant, chest voice to naturally deepen the tone.

### Next Steps:
- If you have the vocal track ready, I can guide you through applying these techniques in your DAW.
- Alternatively, if you're looking for vocal processing plugins or specific settings, let me know, and I can suggest some options!

What do you think? Do you have any specific parts of the vocal that you'd like to focus on?"

  "Great choice! iZotope Nectar is a powerful tool for vocal processing. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to get started with it to achieve that deeper, more reflective vocal tone:

### Getting Started with iZotope Nectar:

1. **Insert Nectar on Your Vocal Track**:
   - Open your DAW and insert the Nectar plugin on the vocal track you want to process.

2. **Use the Vocal Assistant**:
   - When you first open Nectar, you can use the Vocal Assistant to analyze your vocal track. Click on the â€œVocal Assistantâ€ button and follow the prompts. It will suggest settings based on your vocal's characteristics.

3. **EQ Section**:
   - **Low-End Boost**: Add a gentle boost around 80-200Hz to enhance depth. 
   - **High-End Roll-Off**: Use a high-pass filter to cut unnecessary high frequencies (above 10kHz) to soften the vocal.

4. **Compression**:
   - Set the compressor to a moderate ratio (around 3:1). Adjust the threshold until you see some gain reduction, ensuring that the vocal remains dynamic but controlled.

5. **De-esser**:
   - Use the de-esser module to soften any harsh sibilance. Adjust the frequency and threshold until the sibilance is reduced without dulling the vocal.

6. **Reverb**:
   - Add a subtle reverb to create space. Adjust the decay time to find the right balance. Aim for a longer decay to enhance that reflective quality without overwhelming the vocals.

7. **Pitch Correction (if needed)**:
   - If you want to fine-tune the pitch, use the pitch module. Adjust the settings to subtly shift the pitch down for a deeper tone, but be careful not to overdo it.

8. **Output Level**:
   - Finally, check the output level to ensure itâ€™s not clipping. Adjust the output gain if necessary.

### Next Steps:
- Play around with these settings and trust your ears! Make adjustments based on how the vocal sits in the mix.
- If you have any specific sections where you're unsure about the processing, feel free to ask for targeted advice!

How does this sound to you? Ready to give it a try, or do you have any specific features within Nectar you want to explore further?"

  "No problem at all! Letâ€™s take a step back and break this down together. 

### What is a DAW?
A **Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)** is software that allows you to record, edit, and produce audio files. It's where you'll be working on your music, including recording your vocals, adding instruments, and mixing everything together. Some popular DAWs include:

- **Ableton Live**
- **FL Studio**
- **Logic Pro**
- **GarageBand**
- **Pro Tools**

### Getting Started with iZotope Nectar:
If you're new to using a DAW, here's a simplified approach to help you get started with iZotope Nectar:

1. **Choose a DAW**:
   - If you haven't already, consider downloading a user-friendly DAW like GarageBand (if you're on Mac) or FL Studio for Windows. Both have user-friendly interfaces that are great for beginners.

2. **Install iZotope Nectar**:
   - Follow the instructions from iZotope to install Nectar on your computer. Make sure it's recognized by your DAW.

3. **Open Your DAW**:
   - Launch your DAW and create a new project. Look for an option to add an audio track where you can record or import your vocals.

4. **Record or Import Vocals**:
   - If you have vocals recorded, import them into the audio track. If you need to record, connect a microphone and hit the record button.

5. **Insert Nectar**:
   - Find the effects section of your audio track (usually labeled as â€œFXâ€ or â€œInsertâ€) and select iZotope Nectar from the list of available plugins. 

6. **Follow the Vocal Processing Steps**:
   - Now, you can follow the steps I provided for using Nectar to enhance your vocal sound!

### Next Steps:
- If you need help selecting a specific DAW or guidance on how to do any of these steps, just let me know! I'm here to help you every step of the way.
- Once you're comfortable with the basics, we can dive deeper into using Nectar and other production techniques!

How does that sound? Do you have a DAW in mind, or would you like suggestions on where to start?"

  "Awesome! The quantization process is complete, and weâ€™re ready to dive into polishing your demo.

Now, let's focus on enhancing the overall sound. Here are a few areas we can work on:

1. **Instrumentation**: Do you have specific instruments in mind for your country jazz sound? Common choices might include acoustic guitar, banjo, fiddle, or jazz piano.

2. **Vocal Arrangement**: If there are vocals, we can look at harmonies or backing vocals to enrich the sound.

3. **Production Techniques**: We can explore adding reverb, delay, or other effects to create depth and warmth.

4. **Mixing and Mastering**: Balancing all elements to ensure clarity and coherence in the final mix.

Do any of these areas stand out to you? Or do you have other specific aspects youâ€™d like to focus on? Letâ€™s make your demo shine!"

  "Awesome! Hip hop is such a vibrant genre, and focusing on poetic and lyrical elements can really elevate your melody. Here are some tips and strategies to help you craft memorable melodies for your hip hop tracks:

### **Catchy Hooks and Rhythmic Phrasing**
**Main Response:**
1. **Start with a Strong Hook:** A memorable hook is essential in hip hop. Consider creating a melody that is simple yet catchy. Try using a limited range of notes and repeating phrases to make it stick in the listenerâ€™s mind.

2. **Play with Rhythm:** Hip hop often relies on rhythmic complexity. Try varying the length and timing of your melodic phrases to keep the listener engaged. Syncopation can be particularly effective.

3. **Use Call and Response:** This technique can create a dynamic and engaging flow. You could create a melodic line that serves as a "call," followed by a contrasting melodic "response."

### **Incorporate Emotion and Storytelling**
**Deep Dive:**
- **Emotional Variation:** Think about the emotions you want to convey. Use minor scales for a darker feel or major scales for something uplifting. For example, the use of a minor pentatonic scale can give your melody a soulful vibe.

- **Storytelling:** Since you're focusing on lyrical content, let the melody reflect the narrative of your lyrics. If a verse is intense or aggressive, match that with a more driving, forceful melody. Conversely, use a softer melody for more reflective lyrics.

### **Next Steps:**
- **Experiment with Your Ideas:** Try writing a few melodic lines based on the tips above. Record them to see how they flow with your existing lyrics.

- **Analyze Your Favorites:** Listen to some of your favorite hip hop tracks and pay attention to their melodies. Artists like Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole often blend intricate lyrics with memorable melodic hooks.

- **Share Your Melodies:** If you have a melody or a rough idea, feel free to share it, and we can refine it together!

What do you think? Any specific melodies or ideas you want to explore further?"

  "Awesome! Soul rock is a fantastic genre that blends emotional depth with powerful instrumentation. 

To get you started, here are some classic soul rock songs you might find inspiring:
- **"Take Me to Church" by Hozier**: This track mixes soulful melodies with rock instrumentation, creating an impactful sound.

- **"Ain't No Mountain High Enough" by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell**: A timeless soul classic that has a rockin' rhythm and uplifting vibe.

- **"Use Me" by Bill Withers**: This song combines a groovy rhythm with soulful vocals, perfect for capturing that soul rock essence.
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NuYDKzky4z0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen style="border-radius: 12px; width: 100%; height: 300px;"></iframe>

### Hereâ€™s how you can move forward:
- **Incorporate Instrumentation**: Think about using electric guitars with a soulful riff, paired with a strong rhythm section.
- **Lyric Themes**: Consider writing lyrics that convey deep emotion, love, or personal struggles, which are common in both soul and rock music.
- **Vocal Style**: Aim for a powerful vocal delivery that conveys passion and authenticity.

### Next Steps:
1. **Draft some lyrics**: Start with a theme or emotion you want to express.
2. **Create a chord progression**: A common progression in soul rock is I-IV-V or I-vi-ii-V.
3. **Experiment with melodies**: Try different vocal melodies over your chord progression to find what resonates.

Feel free to share any ideas you have, and we can refine them together!"

- **"No Rain" by Blind Melon**: A classic track with a laid-back feel, it combines rock elements with a soulful vibe that resonates well.

- **"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" by Aerosmith**: While more on the rock ballad side, it has that soulful intensity that can inspire your songwriting.

### Moving Forward:
- **Instrumentation**: Focus on using electric guitars, strong bass lines, and possibly even some strings or brass to give it that rich 90s sound.
- **Lyric Themes**: Explore themes of love, longing, or personal struggle, which were prevalent in 90s music.
- **Vocal Style**: Channel that raw emotion in your vocal delivery, think along the lines of artists like Alanis Morissette or Sheryl Crow.

### Next Steps:
1. **Write a Chorus**: Start by crafting a catchy chorus that captures the essence of your song.
2. **Develop a Verse**: Build the story in your verses, leading into that impactful chorus.
3. **Experiment with Production**: Consider using 90s-inspired production techniques, like layering harmonies or using vintage-sounding effects.

If you have any ideas or rough lyrics, feel free to share, and we can refine them together!"

  "make a minor key rock soul hit using the original song"

  "To create a rock soul hit in a minor key using elements from the original song you have in mind, we can start by breaking down the process into manageable steps. 

### Hereâ€™s a general outline to follow:

#### 1. **Choose Your Key and Chord Progression:**
   - **Key**: Let's say you're going with A minor, a common choice for rock and soulful tunes.
   - **Chord Progression**: A classic minor progression could be Am - F - G - Em. This provides a strong emotional grounding.

#### 2. **Develop a Melody:**
   - Create a melody that emphasizes the soulful elements. Use the minor pentatonic scale for inspiration, which will give it a strong rock vibe. Think about using a call-and-response style in your melody, a technique often found in soul music.

#### 3. **Lyric Themes:**
   - Focus on themes of love, struggle, or resilience. Hereâ€™s a quick example of what the lyrics might look like in the chorus:
   ```
   (Chorus)
   In the shadows where the heartache lies,  
   Iâ€™ll rise up high, won't say goodbye,  
   With every note, I break the night,  
   My soulâ€™s the fire, burning bright.
   ```

#### 4. **Instrumentation:**
   - Use electric guitars with a gritty tone for the riffs.
   - Incorporate a strong bassline and a tight drum groove to drive the rhythm.
   - Add some organ or keys for that soulful texture.

#### 5. **Structure:**
   - Typical structure could be:
     - Intro
     - Verse 1
     - Chorus
     - Verse 2
     - Chorus
     - Bridge (maybe a change in dynamics or a key modulation)
     - Final Chorus
     - Outro

### Next Steps:
- **Sketch Your Ideas**: Start writing out the verses and fleshing out the melody.
- **Experiment with Arrangements**: Once you have a rough demo, try layering different instruments and vocal harmonies to bring depth.
- **Share Your Work**: If you have a rough version or specific parts you'd like feedback on, feel free to share!

If you have existing lyrics or concepts you want to integrate, let me know, and we can refine them together!"

  "That sounds like an exciting blend! An electrifying country sound with electric guitar components can really create a unique vibe. Here are some ideas and directions we can explore to polish your demo:

**ğŸ¸ Sonic Elements:**
- **Electric Guitar:** Focus on using bright, clean tones for verses and add some crunch for the chorus. Think of artists like Keith Urban or Brad Paisley, who incorporate electric guitar creatively in their country music.
- **Rhythm Section:** A strong, driving drum beat with a steady bass line will help anchor the track. You might want to include a bit of shuffle in the drums to give it that classic country feel while still keeping it electrifying.

**ğŸ¤ Vocal Arrangement:**
- Layering harmonies can add depth. Consider using call-and-response techniques in the verses for a dynamic interaction in the vocals.

**ğŸ¶ Arrangement Ideas:**
- Start with a simple intro using the electric guitar, then build up to a full band sound for the chorus. This contrast can create an engaging listening experience.

**âœ¨ Production Techniques:**
- Use reverb and delay on the guitars to create a spacious sound.
- For the mix, focus on balancing the vocals with the instruments, ensuring the electric guitar stands out without overpowering the song.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Refine Your Demo:** Make sure your track is in 4/4 and consider re-recording with a metronome if needed.
2. **Upload Again:** Once you have a version that fits the criteria, upload it, and we can start the production process together!
3. **Share Your Ideas:** If you have any specific lyrics or sections you want to focus on, let me know!

Let's make this electrifying country track shine! If you have any rough lyrics or ideas already, feel free to share them, and we can refine them together."

  "Here's a reggae song I've crafted for you titled **"Good Vibes Only."** Check out the lyrics:

### Verse 1
In the morning light, we rise and shine,  
Feel the rhythm of the ocean, so divine.  
With every heartbeat, we find our way,  
Together in harmony, come what may.

### Chorus
Good vibes only, let the music play,  
Dancing in the sunshine, every day.  
Feel the love, let it set you free,  
In this reggae rhythm, you and me.

### Verse 2
Under the stars, we gather 'round,  
Sharing stories, laughter, and the sound.  
Of drums and bass, in the cool night air,  
A melody of peace, beyond compare.

### Chorus
Good vibes only, let the music play,  
Dancing in the sunshine, every day.  
Feel the love, let it set you free,  
In this reggae rhythm, you and me.

### Bridge
When the world feels heavy, and the night is long,  
We'll find our strength in a reggae song.  
Together we'll rise, hand in hand,  
Spreading joy across the land.

### Chorus
Good vibes only, let the music play,  
Dancing in the sunshine, every day.  
Feel the love, let it set you free,  
In this reggae rhythm, you and me.

  "It looks like there was an issue with the upload because the song sketch detected an unsupported time signature. Right now, we only support 4/4 time signatures, and if your song wasn't recorded using a metronome, it may have caused some inconsistencies in detection.

If your song is in a different time signature, you might want to consider adjusting it to 4/4. Alternatively, if you'd like, I can help you explore how to quantize your song to a consistent BPM. Would you like me to do that for you?"

  "It looks like there was an issue with the upload because the demo might be in a time signature that we currently don't supportâ€”specifically, anything other than 4/4. This can happen if the song wasn't recorded using a metronome, which can cause the system to misread the time signature.

To proceed, you can try the following:

1. **Check the Time Signature**: If you're using a time signature other than 4/4, consider converting the demo to 4/4 if that works for your song.

2. **Re-record with a Metronome**: If itâ€™s possible, try recording the demo again with a metronome to keep a consistent beat.

3. **Describe the Demo**: In the meantime, you can share details about your demoâ€”like the genre, mood, and any specific elements you want to enhance. This way, we can still work on ideas to make it better while we sort out the upload.

What do you think?"

  "Absolutely! I'd love to help you craft a solid song structure. To get started, could you share more about what you have so far? For example:

- Do you have any existing lyrics or melodies?
- What genre are you aiming for?
- Are there specific sections (like verses, choruses, bridges) you're considering?

With that information, we can work together to refine your structure!"

  "Great choice! Hip-hop has a flexible and dynamic structure that allows for creativity. Hereâ€™s a basic framework we can work with, plus some ideas to help you build your song:

### Typical Hip-Hop Song Structure:
1. **Intro** - Sets the tone; can be instrumental or feature a hook.
2. **Verse 1** - Introduces the theme or story; typically 16 bars.
3. **Chorus/Hook** - The catchy part that summarizes the song; usually 8 bars.
4. **Verse 2** - Expands on the story or theme; often 16 bars.
5. **Chorus/Hook** - Repeat to reinforce the main message.
6. **Bridge (optional)** - A contrasting section that adds variety; can be instrumental or lyrical.
7. **Verse 3** - A final verse that wraps up the narrative or adds a twist; 16 bars.
8. **Chorus/Hook** - Final repeat to close the song.

### Tips to Elevate Your Structure:
- **Dynamic Flow**: Vary your deliveryâ€”mix up your flow and rhythm to keep it engaging.
- **Storytelling**: Use your verses to tell a story or convey a message. Think about the journey you want to take the listener on.
- **Call and Response**: Incorporate elements where the listener can engage, especially in the hook.

### Next Steps:
- If you have any lyrics or rough ideas for your verses or hook, let's take a look at them together!
- Consider the themes you want to explore in your verses. What is the message or story you want to convey?

Feel free to share what you have, and we can refine it together!"

  "That's a powerful and vivid imagery! I love how youâ€™re using metaphors to convey emotions and experiences. Letâ€™s work on integrating that into your song structure.

### Suggestions for Your Verse:
Your line has a strong emotional weight, so we can build around that. Hereâ€™s an idea for how you might expand it into a full verse:

**Verse 1:**
Fragments of shards glass from an O.E bottle shattered,  
Like broken dreams scattered on pavements of life,  
Each piece a reflection of moments that mattered,  
Echoes of laughter and pain, cutting like a knife.  
In the shadows of alleys where hope used to dwell,  
I walk through the remnants of stories to tell.  
Lessons learned from the streets, the struggle, the strife,  
Searching for solace in this chaotic life.

### Structure Incorporating Your Ideas:
1. **Intro** - Perhaps a spoken word intro or a beat drop.
2. **Verse 1** - Use your lines and the expanded version.
3. **Chorus/Hook** - A catchy line that summarizes this feeling of loss and resilience.
4. **Verse 2** - Continue the narrative: how do you cope? What do you want to achieve?
5. **Chorus/Hook** - Repeat for impact.
6. **Bridge** - A moment of reflection or a turning pointâ€”maybe a shift in tone.
7. **Verse 3** - Conclude the story: whatâ€™s the resolution?
8. **Chorus/Hook** - Wrap it up powerfully.

### Next Steps:
- **Chorus Ideas**: We can brainstorm a catchy hook that ties in with the themes of shattered dreams and resilience.
- **Expand Verse 2**: Think about where you want to take the story next. What emotions or experiences do you want to convey?

Feel free to share any more lines or thoughts, and letâ€™s continue building this together!"

  "Verse 1
Yeah, rise up, feel the anointing in the air,
Jehu's spirit movinâ€™, got that warrior flair.
Kings fall when the truth hits hard,
In the game of life, gotta play your card.
Honor in my stance, never fold, never break,
Take heed to the message, itâ€™s the risk that we take.
From the bottom to the throne, weâ€™re making moves,
Every step heavy, but we got nothing to lose.

Chorus
Take heed, take heed, weâ€™re the voices of the streets,
Where honor meets the hustle, feel the rhythm in the beats.
Stand tall in the struggle, let your spirit rise high,
Jehuâ€™s anointing, weâ€™re the ones who defy.
Verse 2
Heart of a lion, with the soul of a king,
Take heed of the lessons that the struggle can bring.
On the grind every night, while they sleep, we awake,
Built from the ground up, feel the ground shake.
In a world full of snakes, keep the circle tight,
With the anointing power, weâ€™re ready for the fight.
Fearâ€™s a prison, but weâ€™re breaking down the walls,
With every step forward, hear the righteous call.

  "That sounds like an intriguing concept! While I can't create a full song for you directly here, I can definitely help you brainstorm some ideas and themes based on Proverbs 1:10-19 and guide you on how to structure your rap. 

### TLDR:
Let's create a rap that tells a hood story based on the themes of wisdom, temptation, and the consequences of bad choices.

### Main Themes:
1. **Temptation and Peer Pressure**: The verses can highlight how friends may lead you astray, urging you to engage in risky behaviors.
2. **Wisdom's Warning**: Include lines that emphasize the importance of listening to wisdom and avoiding the trap of joining in on wrongdoing.
3. **Consequences**: The consequences of bad choices can be illustrated through vivid storytelling, showing how these actions lead to downfall.

### Suggested Structure:
- **Verse 1**: Introduce the main character and the allure of street life. Show how friends entice him to join in their schemes.
- **Chorus**: A catchy hook that reflects the struggle between following wisdom or falling into temptation.
- **Verse 2**: Dive deeper into the temptation, describing a specific scenario where the character is tempted to act against their better judgment.
- **Chorus**: Repeat the hook, reinforcing the message.
- **Verse 3**: Show the aftermath of giving in to temptation, reflecting on what went wrong and the lessons learned.

### Example Lines:
- **Verse 1**:
  "Yo, my homies callin', sayin' 'come ride with us tonight,'  
  Chasin' that paper, thinkin' we invincible, right.  
  But wisdom whispers softly, 'Keep your head on tight,'  
  Donâ€™t let the streets blind you, stay clear of the fight."

- **Chorus**:
  "Wisdom's callinâ€™, donâ€™t ignore the signs,  
  Temptation lurks, but itâ€™s all in your mind.  
  Stay true to your path, donâ€™t let them lead you wrong,  
  Choose the right way, thatâ€™s where you belong."

- **Verse 2**:
  "Hit the block, see the stash, itâ€™s a quick way to cash,  
  Friends say, â€˜Just one time,â€™ but thatâ€™s how dreams crash.  
  Heart racing, thoughts blurring, caught up in the thrill,  
  But deep down inside, I know itâ€™s time to chill."

- **Verse 3**:
  "Now Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ in the dark, with regrets on my back,  
  Lost some real ones, now Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ that lack.  
  Wisdom was the light, but I turned my face away,  
  Learning every lesson from the price I had to pay."

### Next Steps:
- Let me know if you'd like help refining any specific lines or themes!
- If you have any initial ideas, sketches, or lyrics, feel free to share, and we can enhance them together.
- Once you're ready, we can discuss producing a demo of the song to bring your vision to life!"

  "Absolutely! Letâ€™s craft a rap that embodies the themes we've discussed, blending storytelling with strong hooks to create a compelling track. Hereâ€™s a full rap inspired by Proverbs 1:10-19, structured for a powerful impact.

---

### **Verse 1:**
Yo, the streets be callinâ€™, got my homies on the line,  
â€œCome and ride with us, boy, weâ€™ll be just fine.â€  
Chasinâ€™ paper dreams, livinâ€™ life on the edge,  
But wisdom whispers softly, â€œStay away from the ledge.â€  

They flashinâ€™ all that cash, but whatâ€™s the cost of the game?  
Once you step in that fire, life ainâ€™t never the same.  
â€œJust one hit, just one ride,â€ they say with a grin,  
But deep down inside, I know where this begins.  

### **Chorus:**
Wisdomâ€™s callinâ€™, donâ€™t ignore the signs,  
Temptation lurks, but itâ€™s all in your mind.  
Stay true to your path, donâ€™t let â€˜em lead you wrong,  
Choose the right way, thatâ€™s where you belong.  

### **Verse 2:**
Hit the block, see the stash, itâ€™s a quick way to cash,  
â€œJust one time,â€ they say, but that thrillâ€™s gonna crash.  
Heart racing, thoughts blur, caught up in the thrill,  
But I remember the words, and I know itâ€™s time to chill.  

They flash their shiny toys, livinâ€™ fast, livinâ€™ wild,  
But I see the shadows, knowinâ€™ theyâ€™ll leave me defiled.  
Iâ€™m torn between the hustle and the voice in my head,  
â€œStay on the right track, boy, donâ€™t let â€˜em mislead.â€  

### **Chorus:**
Wisdomâ€™s callinâ€™, donâ€™t ignore the signs,  
Temptation lurks, but itâ€™s all in your mind.  
Stay true to your path, donâ€™t let â€˜em lead you wrong,  
Choose the right way, thatâ€™s where you belong.  

### **Verse 3:**
Now Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ in the dark, with regrets in my chest,  
Lost some real ones, man, this lifeâ€™s a test.  
Thought Iâ€™d be a king, but Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ that lack,  
Wisdom was the light, but I turned my back.  

Now Iâ€™m learninâ€™ lessons from the pain that I bear,  
Every choice that I made, every moment of despair.  
So Iâ€™m takinâ€™ back my life, gonna rise from the fall,  
With wisdom as my guide, Iâ€™ll answer the call.  

### **Chorus:**
Wisdomâ€™s callinâ€™, donâ€™t ignore the signs,  
Temptation lurks, but itâ€™s all in your mind.  
Stay true to your path, donâ€™t let â€˜em lead you wrong,  
Choose the right way, thatâ€™s where you belong.

### **Verse 1:**
Yo, the block be callinâ€™, hear my homies in the night,  
â€œRoll with us, young blood, weâ€™ll be livinâ€™ that life.â€  
Stackinâ€™ paper, flashinâ€™ cash, but it ain't what it seems,  
Wisdom in my ear, sayinâ€™ â€œBoy, chase your dreams.â€  

Got the crew scheminâ€™, temptation in the air,  
â€œJust one hit, one ride, ain't nobody gonna care.â€  
But I see the danger, knowinâ€™ where this leads,  
Blood on these streets, man, thatâ€™s how it feeds.  

### **Chorus:**
When they callinâ€™ you to sin, gotta shut â€˜em down,  
Stayinâ€™ true to your soul, donâ€™t let â€˜em take your crown.  
Wisdomâ€™s yellinâ€™ loud, donâ€™t you let it slide,  
Choose the right path, let your heart be your guide.  

### **Verse 2:**
Hit the corner, see the stash, itâ€™s a quick route to green,  
â€œJust one taste, just one score,â€ but I know what that means.  
Heart poundinâ€™, mind racinâ€™, caught up in the hype,  
But I hear the wisdom sayinâ€™, â€œThis ainâ€™t your type.â€  

They flexinâ€™ all that shine, livinâ€™ fast, livinâ€™ wild,  
But Iâ€™m seeinâ€™ the pain, man, itâ€™s all so vile.  
Ainâ€™t worth the price, got my family to think,  
Every move I make, man, Iâ€™m on the brink.  

### **Chorus:**
When they callinâ€™ you to sin, gotta shut â€˜em down,  
Stayinâ€™ true to your soul, donâ€™t let â€˜em take your crown.  
Wisdomâ€™s yellinâ€™ loud, donâ€™t you let it slide,  
Choose the right path, let your heart be your guide.  

### **Verse 3:**
Now Iâ€™m sittinâ€™ in the dark, with the weight of my sins,  
Lost some real ones, this battle ainâ€™t for wins.  
Thought Iâ€™d be a king, but Iâ€™m feelinâ€™ that cost,  
Wisdom was my light, but I thought I was lost.  

Learninâ€™ from the struggle, painâ€™s a heavy teacher,  
Every choice I made, man, it cuts like a preacher.  
But Iâ€™m takinâ€™ back my life, gonna rise from the fall,  
With wisdom on my side, Iâ€™ll answer that call.  

### **Chorus:**
When they callinâ€™ you to sin, gotta shut â€˜em down,  
Stayinâ€™ true to your soul, donâ€™t let â€˜em take your crown.  
Wisdomâ€™s yellinâ€™ loud, donâ€™t you let it slide,  
Choose the right path, let your heart be your guide.

  "Great! Since you're using Voloco, here are some tips to improve your mix balance:

1. **Preset Selection:** Choose the right preset for your vocals. Voloco offers various presets that can enhance your vocal sound. Experiment with different ones to see which fits best with your beat.

2. **Volume Control:** Use the volume sliders in Voloco to adjust the levels of your vocals and the beat. Make sure the vocals are clear and not drowned out by the beat.

3. **Effects:** Apply effects like reverb and EQ available in Voloco to help your vocals sit better in the mix. Be cautious with reverb to avoid making the mix sound muddy.

4. **Export and Reference:** After mixing, export your track and compare it with professional tracks to ensure your mix balance is on point.

If you have a specific track you want to try automatic mixing on, feel free to upload it here!"

  "To improve the balance between your beat and vocals, consider the following steps:

1. **Relative Levels:** With your current settings, the vocals are louder than the beat. If you want the vocals to stand out, this is a good starting point. However, if the vocals are too dominant, consider lowering them slightly or increasing the beat's level.

2. **Compression:** Apply gentle compression to the vocals to ensure they remain consistent in the mix without overpowering the beat.

3. **EQ Adjustments:** Use EQ to carve out space for the vocals in the beat. For example, reduce some mid frequencies in the beat where the vocals are most prominent.

4. **Reverb and Delay:** Add subtle reverb or delay to the vocals to help them sit better in the mix and blend with the beat.

5. **Automation:** Use volume automation to adjust the levels dynamically throughout the track, ensuring both elements are balanced in different sections.

6. **Reference Tracks:** Compare your mix to professional tracks to ensure your balance is in line with industry standards.

If you want to try an automatic mix, feel free to upload your track!"

  "To improve your mix balance, consider the following tips:

1. **Volume Levels:** Start by setting the volume levels of each track. Ensure that no single track overpowers the others unless it's intended to be the focal point.

2. **Panning:** Use panning to create space in your mix. Spread instruments across the stereo field to avoid clutter and give each element its own space.

3. **EQ:** Use equalization to carve out space for each instrument. Cut frequencies that clash and boost those that help an instrument stand out.

4. **Compression:** Apply compression to control the dynamics of your tracks. This can help maintain a consistent level and prevent any track from jumping out unexpectedly.

5. **Reverb and Delay:** Use reverb and delay to add depth and space. Be careful not to overdo it, as too much can muddy the mix.

6. **Reference Tracks:** Compare your mix to professional tracks in a similar genre. This can help you identify areas where your mix might need adjustment.

7. **Monitor at Different Volumes:** Listen to your mix at various volume levels to ensure it sounds balanced at both low and high volumes.

8. **Take Breaks:** Give your ears a rest periodically to maintain a fresh perspective on your mix.

If you have a specific track you want feedback on, feel free to share more details or upload it for automatic mixing!"
