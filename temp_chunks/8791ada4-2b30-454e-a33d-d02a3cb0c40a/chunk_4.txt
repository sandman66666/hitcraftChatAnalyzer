  "Absolutely! Kathakali is a classical dance-drama from Kerala, known for its vibrant costumes, intricate facial expressions, and powerful storytelling. The music accompanying Kathakali typically features traditional instruments like:

1. **Chenda** - A cylindrical drum that provides the rhythmic backbone.
2. **Maddalam** - A type of hand-played drum that adds depth to the music.
3. **Elathalam** - Cymbals that accentuate the rhythm.
4. **Vocals** - Traditional singers narrate the story, often using unique styles.

If you're looking to incorporate an Indian theme with Kathakali elements into your production, we can definitely explore those sounds and styles! Do you have a specific concept in mind, or would you like to start fresh?"

1. **What key is your melody in?**
2. **Do you have a specific genre or mood in mind?**
3. **What type of melody are you working with? (e.g., upbeat, melancholic, etc.)**

Once I have this information, I can provide you with some great chord progressions that will complement your melody!"

  "Status code 400 typically indicates a "Bad Request." This means that the server couldn't understand the request due to invalid syntax. In the context of uploading a file, it could mean that the file format isn't supported or that there was an issue with the way the request was made.

If you're having trouble uploading your sketch, try checking the file format and size. If the issue persists, let me know, and we can explore alternative ways to help you achieve your goal! 

Now, about the genre switchâ€”do you have a specific genre in mind that you're interested in trying for your song?"
